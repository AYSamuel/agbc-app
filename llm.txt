## Key Features
- **Authentication**: Email/password login and registration with email verification.
- **User Profile**: Profile management with logout functionality.
- **Navigation**: Bottom navigation with Home and Profile tabs.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, modern design with consistent theming and typography.

## Core Components
### Authentication Flow
1. User registration with email verification
2. Email verification check
3. Login with verified credentials
4. Session management and logout

### State Management
- **Provider Pattern**: Used for authentication state
- **AuthService**: Manages user authentication state
- **UserModel**: Represents user data structure

### Firebase Integration
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth for user management
- **Database**: Firestore for user data storage
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for Firebase setup

## Design Patterns
### UI Patterns
- **No AppBar**: Screens use custom headers instead of AppBar
- **Bottom Navigation**: Consistent navigation across main screens
- **Custom Back Buttons**: Platform-specific navigation handling

### Code Patterns
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separated in service classes
- **Widget Composition**: Reusable UI components in widgets directory
- **Theme Consistency**: Centralized theming through AppTheme

## Implementation Details
### Theme System
- Uses Google Fonts (Inter) for typography
- Custom color palette in AppTheme
- Consistent spacing and sizing constants

### Navigation
- MainNavigationScreen manages bottom tabs
- Custom back buttons for iOS compatibility
- Route management for authentication flow

### Authentication
- Email verification required for login
- Secure password handling
- Session persistence

## Future Enhancements
- Task and meeting management features
- Additional profile customization options
- Enhanced church-specific functionalities

## Notes for AI Assistance
- All screens should follow the no-AppBar pattern
- Use AppTheme for consistent styling
- Maintain platform-specific navigation patterns
- Follow the established file structure for new features
- Use Provider for state management
- Implement Firebase services for data persistence
