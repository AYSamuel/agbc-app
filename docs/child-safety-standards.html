      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 19, 2025</p>

      <p>
        Amazing Grace Bible Church (AGBC) and GRACE PORTAL are committed to providing a safe environment for all
        members, especially children and minors. We have zero tolerance for child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE)
        and have implemented comprehensive policies and technical measures to protect children using our platform.
      </p>

      <div class="emergency-box">
        🚨 EMERGENCY REPORTING: If you suspect immediate danger to a child, contact local authorities immediately by
        calling emergency services (999 in the UK, 911 in the US) or contact the National Society for the Prevention
        of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) Helpline at 0808 800 5000.
      </div>
